# Guardrails for Human-AI use cases

Safe AI practices are crucial when developing LLM-powered apps. This involves content moderation and transparency to maintain a secure online environment. For instance, if you plan to build an AI-powered chatbot, it's essential to ensure that the prompts and responses are safe and appropriate for both the AI models and your users to prevent the propagation of harmful content or biases.

The [_Llama Guard 7b_](https://ai.meta.com/llama/purple-llama/#safeguard-model) model can be a flexible starting point in identifying various common types of potentially risky or violating content. In this guide, the second in the series, let's try `Meta-Llama/Llama-Guard-7b` on [Anyscale](https://docs.endpoints.anyscale.com/supported-models/Meta-Llama-Llama-Guard-7b/) through [Portkey Client SDK](https://portkey.ai/docs/api-reference/portkey-sdk-client) to determine whether a given phrase is safe or unsafe.

`PROMPT_TEMPLATE`

The template has a set of instructions to query for proper prompt classification. The context-specific variables can be substituted at runtime. In this case, `$agent_type` and `$prompt`.
